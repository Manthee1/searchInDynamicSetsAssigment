# Collage Assignment 1 â€“ Search in dynamic sets

## About
Your task in this assignment is to implement and then compare 4 implementations of data structures
in terms of the effectiveness of insert, delete and search operations in different situations:
* (3 points) Implementation of a binary search tree (BVS) with any balancing algorithm, e.g. AVL,
Red-Black Trees, (2,3) Trees, (2,3,4) Trees, Splay Trees, ...
* (3 points) Second implementation of BVS with a different balancing algorithm than in the
previous point.
* (3 points) Implementation of a hash table with collision resolution of your choice. The hash
table size adjustment must also be implemented.
* (3 points) Second implementation of the hash table with collision resolution in a different way
than in the previous point. The hash table size adjustment must also be implemented.
