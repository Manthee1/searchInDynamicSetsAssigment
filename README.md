# DSA - Collage Assignment 1 â€“ Search in dynamic sets

## About  

Essentially, this is a simple implementation of two data structures: a **binary search tree** and a **hash table**. Each with two different balancing/collision resolution algorithms.

### The hash table
The hash table is implemented as a linked list of buckets, each of which contains a linked list of key-value pairs. It is used to store the data.
The hash table has collision resolution using **chaining** and **open addressing(Double hashing)**.  

### The binary search tree
The binary search tree is implemented as a linked list of nodes, each of which contains a key and a value. It is used to store the keys in sorted order.
The binary tree is also self-balancing, using the **AVL** algorithm and **Red-Black trees**.
