# DSA - Collage Assignment 1 â€“ Search in dynamic sets

## About  

Essentially, this is a simple implementation of two data structures: a **binary search tree** and a **hash table**. Each with two different balancing/collision resolution algorithms.

### The hash table
The hash table is implemented as a linked list of buckets, each of which contains a linked list of key-value pairs. It is used to store the data.
The hash table has collision resolution using **chaining** and **open addressing(Double hashing)**.  

### The binary search tree
The binary search tree is implemented as a linked list of nodes, each of which contains a key and a value. It is used to store the keys in sorted order.
The binary tree is also self-balancing, using the **AVL** algorithm and **Red-Black trees**.

## Compiling
### Compiling With GUI
First make sure you have glfw3 installed on your system. If you don't, then install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev
or on Arch Linux:

    sudo pacman -S glfw

If you're on Windows or MacOS... Well, good luck. Just kidding, you can download the precompiled binaries from [here](http://www.glfw.org/download.html).
But everything from there on is for you to figure out.

After you have `glfw3` installed, clone the repository and run the following commands in the root directory of the project:

    make


### Compiling Without GUI
If you don't want to use the GUI, you can compile the program without it. Just run the following commands in the root directory of the project:

    make gui=0

Whenever chaning the `gui` flag, you need to run `make clean` first so that the old binaries are deleted.
```bash
make clean
make gui=0
```
This is also true for compiling with the GUI.

### Running
After you have compiled the program, you can run it by executing the following command in the root directory of the project:

```
./bin/searchInDSA
```

## Usage

You can see the usage of the program by running it with the `--help` flag:

``` 
./bin/searchInDSA --help 
```

### GUI Controls

To run the GUI, just run the program wit the `run` flag

```
./bin/searchInDSA run
```

`MouseWheel` - Zoom in/out  
`MouseDrag` - Pan around

You can also use the wigets to do stuff I guess.

### Generating test data

It's a good idead to first generated fixed test data, so that the benchmarks are consistent. To do that, run the program with the `test gen` flag:
```bash
./bin/searchInDSA test gen {testFileName} 1000,10000,100000,1000000 unique #example
# More info about the test command can be found by running ./searchInDSA --help
```
### Running benchmarks

```bash
./bin/searchInDSA test bench fixed {testFileName} a #example
```
## Libraries

This project uses the following libraries:

* [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/) - For window creation and input handling

* [Dear ImGui]((https://www.github.com/ocornut/imgui)) - For the GUI
